# TODO List for Dashboard and Enhanced Search Implementation

- [ ] Create website/dashboard.html with login check, progress marking, streak display, and recommendations
- [ ] Create website/dashboard.js for dashboard functionality (mark days, calculate streak/recommendations)
- [ ] Update website/login.js to redirect to dashboard.html after login
- [ ] Add 'tech' field to projects array in website/script.js (e.g., ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS'])
- [ ] Enhance website/projects.html with filters: difficulty dropdown, tech checkboxes, improved search
- [ ] Update website/script.js to handle new filters and search logic
- [ ] Use localStorage to store completed days for persistence
